# miscFunctions
Ava's miscellaneous analysis functions

The functions here are as follows:

generateBeamspotDatabase.py - uses Monte Carlo simulation to generate a database of the expected sector distribution in the downstream JANUS detector for a wide range of beam offsets

fitBeamspotDatabase.py - extract an experimental beam spot by comparing the measured sector distribution to the database generated by generateBeamspotDatabase.py

generatePhiPattern.py - for a given offset, generates the phi inputs which need to be passed into GOSIA2 in order to apply the beam spot corrections

makeChiSqPlot.py - makes nice plots from the output of the chisquaresurface program used for estimating the uncertainties in the GOSIA2 computed matrix elements
